	Clientside:
		Factory:
			When a player purchases an item from the factory, the Queue array needs that object's value assigned
				When the object is added to the queue, the item's money value is deducted from the player
				If the queue is cancelled, then the value of the items within will be reimbursed to the player
					But only if the factory is not destroyed
			When queueing items, the item's AI unit size is also added to the player's group size unless cancelled
